### ðŸ”ŽHere is the project of High-throughput Image Processing for Screening a Microbial Mutant Library.

It is import to analysis a large number of experiment samples, because micro-scale (sub-nano) analysis chips are based on high throughput mutation of samples. As a part of analysis, image processing is implemented, for high-throughput analysis of microbial mutant library.
